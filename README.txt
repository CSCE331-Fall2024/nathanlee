8/29/2024 - Pushed everything I have worked on for the past 1 1/2 weeks from my local machine. Today I will work on my second style.

8/31/2024 - Finished mostly everything with second style except some touch ups on service / portfolio pages, need to implement qualifications and put full conversation from chatgpt (ai page) before finished with project!

9/1/2024 - Finished all I wanted with second style up until career fair. Consistent style switch between webpages works locally but not on website for some reason, will try to fix later.
