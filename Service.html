                            In this role, I worked as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant in the Discrete Structures for Computing course at Texas A&M University (CSCE 222). Throughout the semester I fostered a productive learning environment for my students by hosting biweekly office hours, and review sessions. This gave me the opportunity to further my connections with driven, like-minded students and allowed them to excel in their studies. Additionally, I created an extensive review video containing relevant exam content utilized by many students in the class. I assisted the professor with grading tests, homework, and quizzes and provided positive, productive feedback to each student. My favorite part of this role was cultivating unique and challenging test questions for each exam that assessed the class's overall performance.
