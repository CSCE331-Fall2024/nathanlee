            <h2>Image Scaling / Image Stitching Algorithm</h2>
            <p>During this project, I created algorithms to scale individual images and stitch two images together. 
                In this project, I bolstered my coding skill in C++ and further understood concepts such as 2D array manipulation, algorithms, and input/output streams. 
                I expanded upon my knowledge of bilinear interpolation to implement the image scaling algorithm. 
                Throughout this experience, I also gained an understanding of Harris's corner detection algorithm for the creation of the image stitching algorithm.

            <p>This project is centered around "MUPL", a Made Up Programming Language (hence the name MUPL) that has the basic functionality 
            of common coding languages. I created a functional, statically typed language with functions, closures, and many different data types.
            Additionally, I made error handling, function calling, recursion, and let expressions all compatible for this custom language all using Racket as a foundation for my language.
            Due to my deep understanding of programming language concepts, I created hall of fame functions and complex algorithms to test my "MUPL" language.
