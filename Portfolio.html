            <h2>Aggies Compute</h2>
            <p>This project was designed to assist students with computer-science-related math, similar to applications such as Wolfram Alpha. </p> 
            <p>With the help of like-minded programmers, we created multiple math algorithms and implemented them into a website. </p>
            <p>This collaborative project helped me develop problem-solving, teamwork and introduced me to new coding concepts and languages.</p>

            <h2>Image Scaling / Image Stitching Algorithm</h2>
            <p>During this project, I created algorithms to scale individual images and stitch two images together. 
                In this project, I bolstered my coding skill in C++ and further understood concepts such as 2D array manipulation, algorithms, and input/output streams. 
                I expanded upon my knowledge of bilinear interpolation to implement the image scaling algorithm. 
                Throughout this experience, I also gained an understanding of Harris's corner detection algorithm for the creation of the image stitching algorithm.

            <p>In this project I developed a retro-style video game using concepts such as pointers and 2D dynamic arrays.</p>
            <p>During the process of creating this video game, I sharpened my understanding of pointers, input/output streams, </p>
            <p>file traversal, memory allocataion and resizing/editing 2D dynamic arrays without risk of memory leaks.</p>
            <p>This project also helped me learn the importance of creating test/edge cases, as I created my own levels that tested</p>
            <p>the accuracy, precision, and stability of the code.</p>

            <h2>Custom Language Interpreter for "MUPL"</h2>
            <p>This project is centered around "MUPL", a Made Up Programming Language (hence the name MUPL) that has the basic functionality 
            of common coding languages. I created a functional, statically typed language with functions, closures, and many different data types.
            Additionally, I made error handling, function calling, recursion, and let expressions all compatible for this custom language all using Racket as a foundation for my language.
            Due to my deep understanding of programming language concepts, I created hall of fame functions and complex algorithms to test my "MUPL" language.

            <p>Using Ruby, I created the puzzle video game Tetris with a simple interface, buttons, and a score counter.</p>
            <p>While working on this project, I developed my knowledge of Object Oriented Programming by working with classes, </p>
